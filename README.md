# tagbar markdown extension

We recommend to use **vim-plug** to install plugin.

```viml
Plug 'majutsushi/tagbar'
Plug 'lvht/tagbar-markdown'
```

Please make sure **php** is in your `$PATH` and the `bin/mdctags` has execute permission.

execute ':MDAgenda' to insert content agenda in the current line.

Enjoy :)
